.SH IDENTIFYING USRPS
.sp
Devices are addressed through key/value string pairs.
These string pairs can be used to narrow down the search for a specific device or group of devices.
Most UHD utility applications and examples have a \-\-args parameter that takes a device address;
where the device address is expressed as a delimited string.
See the documentation in types/device_addr.hpp for reference.
.SS Common device identifiers
.sp
Every device has several ways of identifying it on the host system:

Identifier	Key	Notes

Serial		serial	globally unique identifier

Address		addr	unique identifier on a network

Name		name	optional user\-set identifier

Type		type	hardware series identifier

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Device discovery via command line
.sp
Devices attached to your system can be discovered using the "uhd_find_devices" program.
The find devices program scans your system for supported devices and prints
out an enumerated list of discovered devices and their addresses.
The list of discovered devices can be narrowed down by specifying
device address args.
.sp
Device address arguments can be supplied to narrow the scope of the search.
