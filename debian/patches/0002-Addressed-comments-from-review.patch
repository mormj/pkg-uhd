-\* RX activity LED indicators will blink off in a receive overflow condition, indicating that the host is not receiving samples fast enough.  The host will be notified and output an "O" as well. 
-
+TX LED indicators are on when transimitting data and off when no samples are available to transmit.  RX LED indicators are on when sending samples to the host and off when unable to do so.  This means that TX/RX activity LED indicators will blink off in a temporary transmit underflow or receive overflow condition, indicating that the host is not sending or receiving samples fast enough.  The host will be notified of the condition and output a "U" or "O" as well.
