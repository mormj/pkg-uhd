Universal Hardware Driver Discovery Utility

\section description DESCRIPTION

Find UHD supporting Software Radio Peripherals attached by USB,
network or embedded configuration.

The UHD is the universal hardware driver for Ettus Research
products. The goal of the UHD is to provide a host driver and api for
current and future Ettus Research products. Users will be able to use
the UHD driver standalone or with 3rd party applications.

Hardware supporting UHD drivers includes the Universal Software Radio
Peripheral, or USRP, available in several models.

\section synopsis SYNOPSIS

  uhd_find_devices [OPTIONS]

\section options OPTIONS

--args arg	Device Address Arguments
--help 		This help information

\section id IDENTIFYING USRPS

Devices are addressed through key/value string pairs.
These string pairs can be used to narrow down the search for a specific device or group of devices.
Most UHD utility applications and examples have a \-\-args parameter that takes a device address;
where the device address is expressed as a delimited string.
See the documentation in types/device_addr.hpp for reference.

\subsection cid Common device identifiers

Every device has several ways of identifying it on the host system:

Identifier	Key	Notes

Serial		serial	globally unique identifier

Address		addr	unique identifier on a network

Name		name	optional user\-set identifier

Type		type	hardware series identifier


\section examples EXAMPLES

\subsection cld Device discovery via command line

Devices attached to your system can be discovered using the "uhd_find_devices" program.
The find devices program scans your system for supported devices and prints
out an enumerated list of discovered devices and their addresses.
The list of discovered devices can be narrowed down by specifying
device address args.

Device address arguments can be supplied to narrow the scope of the search.
