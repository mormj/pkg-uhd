Description: universal hardware driver for Ettus Research products
 Host utilities for the Universal Hardware Driver for Ettus Research products.
 .
 The supported devices provide analog radio receiver and transmitter hardware
 along with digital interfaces for getting signals to and from a software
 defined radio running on the host computer.
 .
 This package includes the uhd_find_devices application to locate and
 configure attached peripherals, the uhd_usrp_probe application to
 display hardware configuration information and Doxygen generated
 documentation.
